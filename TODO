Implement clustering of sensors and find way how to cluster efficiently.
Encode date and time as well, not only the traffic occupancy, for better prediction
Implement GA and FL for fine tuning hyperparameters
Hybrid Loss function for better performance
Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting
More models like LSTM, maybe some lighter models for faster inference
Implement test script and metrics visualization modules
